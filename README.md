# Character Creator App

This is my Character Creator/ Tracker app for artists like me!
There is a welcome page, a page on how to create a character and how to navigate to another page which allows you to generate random ai 
characters with an API to a AI website called https://generated.photos/. 
You just click on it and it generates an AI human. 
The about page has additional information for my repository.
The most important page, the character page, tracks all of your characters with their
names, images, date created, where they live, and any background information.
They can also be sorted alphabetically via a sort button, deleted via a ":(" button, and liked via a like button.
You can also add a new character at the bottom. 
If you donâ€™t have an image, use a background image from the background photo.
